## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to predict either a binary class of HOSPITAL_EXPIRE_FLAG or a regression of the Length of Stay. 

### Methods Used

* Data Visualization
* Binary Classification
* Regression
* Neural Networks
* Ensembles
* SVM
* KNN

### Technologies
* Python

## Project Description
In this project, you have to predict the length of stay (in days) of a patient that is entering an ICU (Intensive Care Unit) or predict the probability of death of a patient that is entering an ICU (Intensive Care Unit).

The dataset comes from MIMIC project (https://mimic.physionet.org/). MIMIC-III (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III) is a large, freely-available database comprising deidentified health-related data associated with over forty thousand patients who stayed in critical care units of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center between 2001 and 2012.
